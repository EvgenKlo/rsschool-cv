## About Me
I am 33 years old. I worked in a car dealership for 10 years. Performed the duties of a service consultant for the body repair department. Just completed a course on programming from RS School (JS / FRONT-END. STAGE 0). The course was excellent and I am very glad that one day my friend recommended RSS to me. I am just starting to get to know this wonderful world of programming and I understand that in fact this is what I have wanted for a very long time. I am ready to devote all my free time to learning programming and I am sure that I will succeed.

        if(massiveStr[i] === element[0] && massiveStr[i+1] === element[1]){
          massiveStr.splice(i, 2);
          findPair();
