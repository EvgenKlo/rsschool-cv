## About Me
I am 33 years old. Until now, he has worked for 10 years in various car dealerships as a service consultant in the body repair department. I have absolutely no programming experience. I am just starting to explore this wonderful world and I understand that in fact I already really wanted to do just that. With difficulty figured out how to work in VS Code. I am ready to devote all my free time to learning programming and I am sure that I will succeed.
